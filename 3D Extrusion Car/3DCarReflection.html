<h1>3D Car Reflection</h1>
<p><I>This is a reflection of the 3D car project, in which we modeled and developed 3D cars. After completing a process that included taking measurements, sketching, and modeling on design software, we used 3D printers to develop our toy car replicas. . </p></I>

<h3><u>3D Model</u></h3>
<p><I>This is an online 3D model of my car created using Modelo</I></p>
<div class='modelo-wrapper'> <div style="width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative"> <div style="position: absolute; top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;"> <iframe src="https://app.modelo.io/embedded/QHUwUFfHyA?viewport=false&autoplay=false&autoRotate=false&hideTools=false" style="width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen allowfullscreen ></iframe> </div> </div> </div>


<h3><u>Project Guidelines</u></h3>
<p><I>These were the guidelines for the project:</I></p>
<ul>
<li>Car designed as an intersection of three forms</li>
<li>Ratio of designed car is 1:1</li>
<li>Size accuracy ±1%</li>
<li>Design exported as STL</li>
<li>Cura is used to orient model for 3D printing and minimize support material</li>
<li>File exported as a GCODE</li>
<li>Final design shared as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Project Steps</u></h3>
<p><I>These were the project steps we took to complete the process, from taking measurements, to printing the final car:</I></p>

<ol>
<li>Measuring and drawing toy car model to scale</li>
<li>Using the engineering drawing to make a 3D model of the car</li>
<li>Printing the model</li>
<li>Documenting the process through a CAD drawing and finding margin of error</li>
</ol>


<h3><u>The Process</u></h3>
<p><I>Here was my process for creating the 3D car as I went through the project steps:</I></p>

<p>I began by choosing a toy to model my 3D creation off of and proceeded to use a caliper to take measurements of the length, width, and height in order to create a model that was to scale. With these measurements, I created an engineering drawing, showing the car from the front, side, and top angles, as well as from a 3D view. </p>

</figure>

<p>With the design software OnShape, I used my engineering drawing as a reference to make a 3D model of the car. Through this process, I drew profiles on each side plane and used the extrusion tool to remove negative spaces from the model as well as the fillet tool to smooth out the edges. Once the foundation of the car was finished, I expanded my knowledge of the software to add wheel wells, a front windshield, and two windows to both sides of the car.</p>

<p>Once the design was complete, I imported my design into Ultimater Cura to prepare my model for the 3D printing machine. Here, I positioned the model on build plates in order to minimize support material needed, and set the nozzle to 0.6mm. I chose a green color for my car and exported the file as a GCODE. The printed model is made of Polylactic Acid. </p>

<p>Next, I created a CAD drawing to give more insight into the different sides and details of the car. Once it was complete, I compared it with my engineering drawing to calculate the margin of error. I then imported my design into Modelo to create an online 3D model of the car (see top of page)</p>

<h3><u>Challenges, Setbacks and Solutions</u></h3>
<p><I>These were two of the challenges I faced during this process with the ways in which I overcame them:</I></p>
<p>One challenge I faced was during my design process on OnShape. I realized after designing the car that the angle of the front hood did not mirror that of the toy car I was modeling off of. I had originally drawn it as a rectangle, but when looking closer at my model, I realized the corners were actually curved. I was able to solve this discrepancy by going back into the layer in which I had drawn the top of my car, and editing the corners to correctly match the toy car. This helped make my design more accurate.</p>
<p>Another challenge I faced occurred while making the CAD drawing. After adding my front, side, and top views, I found it difficult to find the right angle for the view from the car’s front corner. When I tried to add the isometric view, the car was backwards. After talking as a class, we were able to solve this problem by using the projected view function.</p>

<h3><u>Final Result</u></h3>
<p><I>This is my completed 3D car with the model for reference</I></p>
